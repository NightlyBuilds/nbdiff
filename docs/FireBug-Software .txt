Firebug is a web development tool that facilitates the debugging, editing, and monitoring of any website's CSS, HTML, DOM, XHR, and JavaScript; it also provides other web development tools.[2] Firebug's JavaScript panel can log errors, profile function calls, and enable the developer to run arbitrary JavaScript. Its net panel can monitor URLs that the browser requests, such as external CSS, JavaScript, and image files. The net panel can display both request headers and response headers for each page asset; it can also estimate the time each asset took to load.
Firebug is free and open source; it is licensed under the BSD license.[3] Firebug was initially written in January 2006[4] by Joe Hewitt, one of the original Firefox creators. The Firebug Working Group oversees the open source development and extension of Firebug. It has two major implementations: an extension (add-on) for Mozilla Firefox and a bookmarklet implementation called Firebug Lite.[5] A cross-browser version is in development. Currently, the Firebug add-on has over 3 million active daily users.[6]
In addition to debugging web pages, Firebug is a useful tool for web security testing[2] and web page performance analysis.[7]
